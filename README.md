# shell_script_TG
## load data using shell_script in tigergraph graph database 


- you need to create loading job and show your job id, 
  1. gsql and use graph into the graph that you use and then show the list of content in that graph 
- if you want to run that script every hour or when the data is ready to load, in this case the data soource is from another database and you need to load data into spesific time 
  you will need a crontab to run that script, if the data source is using teradata you need to create tpt script to get data from teradata
